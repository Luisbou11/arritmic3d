# Changelog

## [3.0b7] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- **Sensor Support**: Load sensor points from input VTK, automatically collect data during simulation, and save results to a dedicated directory (`sensors/`).
- **APD/CV Memory Effects**: Implementation of memory coefficients for Action Potential Duration (APD) and Conduction Velocity (CV).
- **Back reactivation checks**: During activation, check if a neighbour node could have been our source of activation, preventing espureous reentries.
- **Tissue Models**: Added the `CORE` tissue restitution model.
- **Output Configuration**: Option to configure specific fields in the output VTK and define an initial time for timers (`SetTimer`). Possibility to save to `.vtu` for lighter output.
- **CLI Tools**: New tools for converting legacy restitution curves to surfaces and surface processing (e.g., NaN removal).
- **Test Cases**: Added tests for reentry, rotors, heterogeneous slab configurations, and wire blockage.

### Changed
- **Class Refactoring**: `ConductionVelocity` and `ActionPotential` classes now interact directly with `node_parameters` for better code consistency.
- **I/O Improvements**: Optimized VTK saving and automatic thresholding for easier visualization.
- **build_slab Flexibility**: The function now accepts a list of arguments, improving scriptability.
- **Documentation**: Added usage documentation for sensors, relative model path management, and other new features.

### Fixed
- **LAT Synchronization**: Fixed Local Activation Time (LAT) synchronization between nodes and APD models.
- **Isotropy Checks**: Improved robustness in local isotropy detection for heterogeneous fiber orientations.
- **Initialization**: Corrected APD initialization and handling of constant surfaces.
- **Paths and Timing**: Fixed test output paths and set the default first activation time to 0.
- **Long APD reactivation default disabled**: By default, long APD reactivation is disabled (experimental feature).

## [3.0b6] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- New `GetAP()` method to retrieve the action potential using an analytic expression.
- Support for using library restitution models by name (e.g., "TorOrd_APD") instead of requiring full file paths.
- Implementation of `SaveState` and `LoadState` for `Node` and `CardiacTissue` for full simulation persistence.
- Automatic fetching of Eigen3 during build if not present on the system.
- New visualization functions for slabs and simulation results using PyVista.
- Comprehensive documentation for the Python API and library models usage.
- Lazy loading of submodules in the package namespace to improve import performance.

### Changed
- Refactored build infrastructure using GitHub Actions for multi-platform distribution.
- Restitution models are now bundled and distributed within the Python package.
- Improved `build_slab` interface to handle file saving and region definitions internally.
- Module renamed to `arritmic3d` for consistency with Python naming conventions.

### Fixed
- Corrected missing attributes in `SaveState`/`LoadState` serialization.
- Fixed model name resolution when paths were not absolute.
- Resolved various issues in the CI/CD pipeline for PyPI publication.
- Improved geometry validation when loading simulation states.
